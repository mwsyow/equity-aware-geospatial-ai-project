# Index Travel Accessibility

This module calculates and analyzes travel accessibility indices AKA TravelTime Index for geospatial datasets. It is part of the Equity-Aware Geospatial AI Project and is designed to help assess how easily different locations can be reached within a given area, supporting equity-focused urban and transportation planning.

## Features

- Computes travel accessibility indices using geospatial data
- Outputs results (dictionary) for further analysis and visualization
- Creates various Maps for geospatial visualization of Hospitals and sample points.

## Usage

1. For running this particular Index section or the Travel Time Index pipeline. run the `TAI.py` file to get the TravelTime Index.

## Project Structure

- `TAI.py` - Generates the Travel Time Index Dictionary with AGS code of districts as Key and Avg. travel time as values. use the RUN() function to run the entire pipeline.
- `travel_time_and_centroids.py` - For the Travel Time Matrix and getting centroids
- `data/` - Input and output data files
